# rails4-twitch-tib
Have you ever played an mmo that requires a lexicon of knowledge and laser-like focus but your raid leader or flight commander doesn't seem up to it?
Do you know the ropes but wish there was more of an incentive to lead your fellow players?
This is a rails 4 app that uses twitch api, twitter api, and devise to create a social groundwork for tipping players for hourly play as well as creating a portfolio. 

Im using devise for authentication, and plan on using paypal-express for a payment system. I also want to make a framework for payments in bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, etc. All payments need to take place per a time basis in order to incentivise players to continue in their roles.
